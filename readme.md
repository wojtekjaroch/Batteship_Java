# Battleship OOP Game

## Introduction
The Battleship OOP endeavor is a rendition of the traditional Battleship game designed for two players, constructed with the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
This undertaking draws inspiration from the swift progression in microcomputers and the eagerness to glean insights from real-time interactions and modifications.

## Project Description
In this interactive rendition of Battleship, two players participate in naval warfare by strategically positioning ships and attempting to deduce the location of their opponent's fleet. 
The game is meticulously crafted to embody diverse Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring not only a captivating gameplay experience but also a thoughtful design approach.

## Learning Objectives
- **UML Diagrams**: Understanding the structure and relationships in OOP.
- **Clean Code Practices**: Writing readable, reusable, and refactorable code.
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance.
- **Java Specifics**: Enums, SOLID principles, packaging, getters, and setters.

## Game Features
- **Multiple Player Modes**: Play against a computer or another player.
- **Dynamic Game Board**: Interactive and responsive game board.
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Employ strategy in ship placement and targeting.

## Project Organization
The repository is organized into packages with each class and method serving a distinct purpose, ensuring clean and maintainable code structure.

## Development Requirements
**Backend Development**: The game logic is built in Java, focusing on OOP principles and clean code practices.

## Future Improvements
Future updates can include AI enhancements, graphical UI improvements, and network play capabilities.
